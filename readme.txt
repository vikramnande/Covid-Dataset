Radiological investigations have a high sensitivity for diagnosing COVID-19. We are a pro bono public health research initiative building the COVID-19 RADS and your contribution with scans and observations can help us build AI assisted reporting and data standards. We welcome Physicians, Public Health researchers and practitioners, Policy Makers, AI model builders and data science researchers, Pro bono initiatives, organizations and individuals dedicated to use the datasets and engineer scalable rapid screening solutions.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019â€“20 coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

COVID-19 RADS is a community intellect contribution driven Radiology Reporting and Data Standards for clinical management of COVID-19 symptomatic cases.

Access COVID-19 RADS and Whitepapers
Access the COVID-19 RADS sheets for reporting of X-Ray, CT and Ultrasound scans. Read more about how we are building the COVID-19 RADS with AI assistance, published case report and clinical literature, and your crowdsourced knowledge contribution.

Access Dataset to build AI Models
As an AI model builder and data science researcher, you can gain access to X-Ray, CT and Ultrasound scans, annotations of observations in COVID-19 RADS, shared anonymously under Creative Commons License for building image based screening models and to refine the COVID-19 RADS.

Contribute to the Dataport
As a Radiologist you can contribute scans of suspicious cases and PCR if available to build a crowdsourced repository of case reports. Share anonymously under Creative Commons License and these will be used for rapidly building AI driven radiology reporting and data standards.

Browse Case Reports
See example scans annotated using the COVID-19 RADS to learn about observations in suspicious patients which indicate their differential diagnosis. All images and consolidated annotations are shared anonymously under Creative Commons License

Contribute Annotations to COVID-19 RADS
As a Radiologist you can contribute by annotating our existing library of cases with your observations. These crowdsourced annotations will be used for associating observations to diagnostic outcomes indicative of COVID-19, assisted by AI models to accelerate this process.

Contribute to the AI Model Zoo
Share your AI models for COVID-19 RADS improvisation and image classification on our model zoo, which can be accessed by others in the community for accelerating and scaling up radiological screening for COVID-19. Share your code base under Apache-2.0 and trained models under
